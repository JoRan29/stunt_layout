            C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks. Oh. Well gee, I
            don't know. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What
            happens to us in the future?

            Oh. This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is
            amorously infatuated with you instead of your father.

            Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. So tell me, future boy,
            who's president of the United States in 1985? We do now.

            no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head?

            Flux capacitor. Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? Well, it
            will just happen. Like the way I met your father. That's right,
            twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the
            future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind.
            I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series.
            Sit here, Marty.
