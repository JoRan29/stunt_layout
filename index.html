            that he takes her to the dance.

            who's president of the United States in 1985? We do now. I don't
            wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about
            you. Ah. Whoa. No, Biff, you leave her alone.

            will just happen. Like the way I met your father. That's right,
            twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the
            future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind.
            I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series.
            Sit here, Marty. How's your head? Alright kid, you stick to your
            father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance.
